# **Custom Resource Definitions**

A custom resource definition (CRD) file defines our own object kinds and lets the Kubernetes API Server handle the entire lifecycle. For more information please see [Kubernetes Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).

The above YAML is the deployment file of CRD supported by Citrix Ingress Controller. Detailed information on how to use the CRD please refer [this](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/docs/rewrite-responder-policy.md).
