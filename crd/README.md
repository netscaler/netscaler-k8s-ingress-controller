# **Custom Resource Definitions**

A custom resource definition (CRD) file defines our own object kinds and lets the Kubernetes API Server handle the entire lifecycle. For more information please see [Kubernetes Custom Resources](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/).

The above YAML is the deployment file of CRD supported by Citrix Ingress Controller. Detailed information on how to use the CRD, see [Use Rewrite and Responder policies in Kubernetes](../docs/crds/rewrite-responder.md).
