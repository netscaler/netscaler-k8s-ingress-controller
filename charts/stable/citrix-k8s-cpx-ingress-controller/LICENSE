This is a legal agreement ("AGREEMENT") between the end-user customer ("you"), and the providing Citrix entity (the applicable providing entity is hereinafter referred to as "CITRIX"). This AGREEMENT includes the Data Processing Agreement, the Citrix Services Security Exhibit and any other documents incorporated herein by reference. Your location of receipt of the Citrix product (hereinafter "PRODUCT") and maintenance (hereinafter "MAINTENANCE") determines the providing entity as identified at https://www.citrix.com/buy/licensing/citrix-providing-entities.html. BY INSTALLING AND/OR USING THE PRODUCT, YOU AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT, DO NOT INSTALL AND/OR USE THE PRODUCT. Nothing contained in any purchase order or any other document submitted by you shall in any way modify or add to the terms and conditions contained in this AGREEMENT.
1. PRODUCT LICENSES.
a. End User Licenses. Citrix hereby grants Customer a non-exclusive worldwide license to use the software in a software PRODUCT and the software installed in an appliance PRODUCT under the license models identified at https://www.citrix.com/buy/licensing/product.html. Any experimental features delivered with such software will be identified and are licensed only for internal testing purposes. "Software" means a Citrix proprietary and/or open source software program in object code form licensed hereunder. "Appliance" means a hardware appliance with installed Software. Notwithstanding anything set forth in this AGREEMENT or at the referenced website, your use of open source software shall in all ways be exclusively governed by the open source license indicated as applicable to the code at https://www.citrix.com/buy/licensing/open-source.html.
Your license to software in a Software or Appliance PRODUCT will be activated by license keys that allow use of the PRODUCT in increments defined by the license model purchased ("License Keys"). License Keys for other CITRIX products or other editions of the same PRODUCT may not be used to increase the allowable use for your edition of the PRODUCT.
b. Partner Demo. If a Software PRODUCT is labeled "Partner Demo," notwithstanding any term to the contrary in this AGREEMENT, your license permits use only if you are a current CITRIX authorized distributor or reseller, and then only for demonstration, test, or evaluation purposes in support of your end-user customers, and not for any other purpose, including without limitation customer training or production purposes. Note that a Partner Demo PRODUCT may disable itself upon the expiration of the License Key. In no event may a Partner Demo PRODUCT be used beyond expiration.
c. Evaluation. If a Software PRODUCT is labeled "Evaluation," notwithstanding any term to the contrary in this AGREEMENT, your license permits use only if you are an end-user customer and then only for your internal demonstration, test, or evaluation purposes, and not for any other purpose, including without limitation production purposes. Your license is for ninety (90) days with no right to MAINTENANCE, the Limited Warranty, or Infringement Indemnification. Note that an Evaluation PRODUCT may disable itself upon the expiration of the License Key. In no event may an Evaluation PRODUCT be used beyond expiration.
d. Archive Copy. You may make one (1) copy of the software in a Software or Appliance PRODUCT in machine- readable form solely for backup, provided that you reproduce all proprietary notices on the copy.
2. MAINTENANCE. The MAINTENANCE plan applicable to this PRODUCT is identified at https://www.citrix.com/buy/licensing/product.html and plan entitlements and requirements are explained at https://www.citrix.com/support/programs.html. MAINTENANCE is required at the time of PRODUCT purchase and must be purchased separately. MAINTENANCE is available for an initial one (1) year term and may automatically renew or be extended by your purchase of available annual renewals (the "MAINTENANCE Term"). The MAINTENANCE offering you purchase determines how renewals work. In the event your offering includes automatic renewals, should you wish to allow MAINTENANCE to expire at the end of your then current term, you must provide Citrix thirty (30) days advance written notice. MAINTENANCE for a Software or Appliance PRODUCT begins upon delivery of the License Keys. During the initial or a renewal MAINTENANCE Term, CITRIX will make any Updates for the PRODUCT covered by the plan available to you. An "Update" shall mean a generally available release of the
     
same edition of the Software for the same PRODUCT that Citrix may make available from time to time. CITRIX is not obligated to make any Updates available. Updates shall be subject to the terms of this AGREEMENT, except that Updates are not covered by the Limited Warranty applicable to the PRODUCT, to the extent permitted by applicable law. You acknowledge that CITRIX may develop and market new or different software or appliance offerings or editions of the PRODUCT that use portions of the PRODUCT and that perform all or part of the functions performed by the PRODUCT. Nothing contained in this AGREEMENT shall give you any rights with respect to such new or different offerings or editions. The MAINTENANCE plan may be purchased for the PRODUCT until it is no longer offered in accordance with the applicable CITRIX PRODUCT Lifecycle Support Policy posted at https://www.citrix.com/support/product-lifecycle.html. Any deliveries of Updates shall be electronic. The MAINTENANCE plan includes technical support, and may include online services, and, for hardware only, an extended hardware warranty, as stated at https://www.citrix.com/support/programs.html. The offering you purchase determines your entitlement and usage rights. In addition to your MAINTENANCE plan, you may also purchase CITRIX consulting services as may be available (including installation services, remote monitoring services or technical consulting). CITRIX’ provision of technical support or consulting services is predicated upon the following responsibilities being fulfilled by you: (i) you will designate a primary administrative contact for technical support; (ii) you agree to perform reasonable problem determination activities and reasonable problem resolution activities as suggested by CITRIX; (iii) you are responsible for implementing procedures necessary to safeguard the integrity and security of software and data from unauthorized access and for reconstructing any lost or altered files resulting from catastrophic failures; (iv) you are responsible for procuring, installing, and maintaining all equipment, telephone lines, communications interfaces, and other hardware at your site and providing CITRIX with access to your facilities as required to operate the PRODUCT and permitting CITRIX to perform the service; and (v) you are required to implement all currently available and applicable software hotfixes, hotfix rollup packs, and service packs or their equivalent for the PRODUCT in a timely manner. CITRIX is not required to provide any technical support for problems arising out of: (i) your or any third party’s alterations or additions to the PRODUCT, operating system or environment; (ii) CITRIX provided alterations or additions to the PRODUCT that do not address Errors or Defects; (iii) any functionality not defined in the user documentation published by CITRIX and included with the PRODUCT (hereinafter "Documentation"); (iv) use of a Software PRODUCT on a processor or peripherals other than the processor and peripherals defined in the Documentation; (v) any PRODUCT that has reached End-of-Life; and (vi) any consulting deliverables from CITRIX, you or any third party. An "Error" is defined as a failure in the PRODUCT to materially conform to the functionality defined in the Documentation. A "Defect" is defined as a failure in the PRODUCT to conform to the specifications in the Documentation. In situations where CITRIX cannot provide a satisfactory resolution to your critical problem through normal technical support methods, CITRIX may engage its product development team to create a private fix. Private fixes are designed to address your specific situation and may not be further distributed by you. CITRIX retains all right, title, and interest in and to all fixes, packs and their equivalent. Any private fixes are not provided as part of the PRODUCT under the terms of this AGREEMENT and they are not covered by the Limited Warranty or Infringement Indemnification applicable to the PRODUCT, to the extent permitted by applicable law. With respect to CITRIX consulting services, all intellectual property rights in all deliverables, pre-existing works and derivative works of such pre-existing works, as well as developments made, conceived, created, discovered, invented, or reduced to practice in the performance of the assessment are and shall remain the sole and absolute property of CITRIX, subject to a worldwide, non-exclusive license to you for internal use.
3. DESCRIPTION OF OTHER RIGHTS, LIMITATIONS, AND OBLIGATIONS. Except as expressly set forth in Section 12, you may not transfer, rent, timeshare, grant rights in or lease the PRODUCT except to the extent such foregoing restriction is prohibited by applicable mandatory law. Any attempt to do so in violation of this prohibition shall be void. If you purchased or otherwise received replacement License Keys as part of a PRODUCT upgrade or trade-up, or a new product release with new product licenses under MAINTENANCE, you agree to destroy the original License Keys and retain no copies after installation of the new License Keys and PRODUCT. Solely for the purpose of migrating users, you are permitted a ninety (90) day grace period to run both your new and old License Keys in production. This period begins with your purchase of the upgrade or trade-up, or with your download of the new release under MAINTENANCE. You shall provide the serial numbers of the original License Keys and corresponding replacement License Keys to the reseller and, upon request, directly to CITRIX, for tracking purposes. In the event you make a transfer of the PRODUCT in the EU or EER, to the extent permitted by law and notwithstanding the terms
  
of this AGREEMENT, you must uninstall the PRODUCT and License Keys, cease your use, transfer them to the transferee and retain no copies. You are responsible for ensuring that the transferee accepts the terms of this AGREEMENT. You must provide evidence that the conditions for a lawful transfer of the PRODUCT are met. All Limited Warranty, MAINTENANCE and Infringement Indemnification rights will terminate automatically upon such transfer and will not be available to the transferee, including the ability to purchase MAINTENANCE. You must comply with applicable export laws with respect to such a transfer. You may not modify, translate, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, create derivative works based on or copy the PRODUCT, except as expressly licensed in this AGREEMENT or to the extent such foregoing restriction is expressly prohibited by applicable mandatory law. You may not remove any proprietary notices, labels or marks on the PRODUCT. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this AGREEMENT shall not prevent or restrict you from exercising additional or different rights to any portions of the PRODUCT that are open source software. To the extent permitted by applicable law, you agree to allow CITRIX to audit your compliance with the terms of this AGREEMENT upon prior written notice and during normal business hours, but no more than once per year. Any audit, which may be conducted on premises, shall not unreasonably interfere with your business activities. You will reasonably cooperate with CITRIX and the auditor and will, without prejudice to other rights of CITRIX, address any non-compliance identified by the audit, including, but not limited to, promptly paying any fees owed. Excess license usage will be determined based on your peak usage and billed to you at the then-current Citrix suggested retail price for licenses, and for maintenance on those licenses (for the lesser of the duration of the excess usage or two years). If the audit discloses an underpayment of ten percent (10%) or more of fees owed for the period audited or other material breach of this AGREEMENT, you agree to also reimburse CITRIX for the reasonable audit expenses. Note that a PRODUCT may be provided with identified experimental features that are not part of the PRODUCT and that are not covered by MAINTENANCE and the Limited Warranty. Such features are offered AS IS and may never become part of the PRODUCT or any CITRIX commercial product. Citrix makes no representations or certifications with respect to experimental features.
ALL RIGHTS IN THE PRODUCT NOT EXPRESSLY GRANTED ARE RESERVED BY CITRIX OR ITS LICENSORS. CITRIX and/or its licensors own and retain all title and ownership of all intellectual property rights in and to the PRODUCT, including any adaptations, modifications, translations, derivative works or copies, and any relating to the design, manufacture, or operation of the same.
4. INFRINGEMENT INDEMNIFICATION. In the event of any claim, suit, or proceeding brought against you based on an allegation that a PRODUCT, experimental features or consulting deliverable hereunder (excluding open source software) infringes upon any patent, copyright or trade secret of any third party ("Infringement Claim"), CITRIX shall defend, or at its option, settle, such Infringement Claim, and shall pay all costs (including reasonable attorney’s fees) associated with the defense of such Infringement Claim, and all damages finally awarded or settlements undertaken by CITRIX in resolution of such Infringement Claim, provided you: (i) promptly notify CITRIX in writing of your notification or discovery of an Infringement Claim such that CITRIX is not prejudiced by any delay in such notification; (ii) give CITRIX sole control over the defense or settlement of the Infringement Claim; and (iii) provide reasonable assistance in the defense of the same. Following notice of an Infringement Claim, or if CITRIX believes such a claim is likely, CITRIX may at its sole expense and option: (i) procure for you the right to continue to use the alleged infringing PRODUCT, experimental feature or consulting deliverable; (ii) replace or modify the PRODUCT, experimental feature or consulting deliverable to make it non-infringing; or (iii) accept return of the PRODUCT, experimental feature or consulting deliverable and, for the PRODUCT, provide you with a prorated refund for the PRODUCT, using a three (3) year straight line depreciation basis for the PRODUCT, or, for the consulting deliverable, refund payments made for the deliverable. CITRIX assumes no liability, and shall have no liability, for any Infringement Claims or allegations of infringement based on: (i) your use of any PRODUCT, experimental feature or consulting deliverable after notice that you should cease use of such PRODUCT, experimental feature or consulting deliverable due to an Infringement Claim; (ii) any modification of the PRODUCT, experimental feature or consulting deliverable by you or at your direction; (iii) your combination of the PRODUCT, experimental feature or consulting deliverable with non-CITRIX hardware, software, services, data or other content or materials if such Infringement Claim would have been avoided by the use of the PRODUCT, experimental feature or consulting deliverable alone. THE FOREGOING STATES YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WITH RESPECT TO ANY INFRINGEMENT CLAIM OR ALLEGATION OF INFRINGEMENT.

5. LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER. CITRIX warrants that for a period of ninety (90) days from delivery of the License Keys, the software in a Software or Appliance PRODUCT will perform substantially in accordance with the PRODUCT’s Documentation.

CITRIX and its licensors’ and suppliers’ ("SUPPLIERS’") entire liability and your exclusive remedy under this software or hardware warranty (which is subject to your return of the PRODUCT to CITRIX or an authorized reseller) will be, at the sole option of CITRIX and subject to applicable law, to replace the PRODUCT or to refund the purchase price and terminate your license to any software on the PRODUCT. CITRIX will provide MAINTENANCE (including consulting services, if purchased separately) in a professional and workmanlike manner, but CITRIX cannot guarantee that every question or problem raised by you will be resolved or resolved in a certain amount of time. Citrix does not warrant in any form the results or achievements of the PRODUCT, technical support, consulting services or related deliverables. With respect to technical support, CITRIX’ and its SUPPLIERS’ entire liability and your exclusive remedy under this warranty is re-performance of the services. With respect to consulting services, CITRIX’ and its SUPPLIERS’ entire liability and your exclusive remedy under this warranty is re-performance of the services or, if re-performance is not possible or conforming, refund of amounts paid for the non-conforming services.
