# Deploy Citrix ADC-Integrated Canary Deployment Solution (**Beta**)

>**IMPORTANT**
>This is the beta version of the solution which is still undergoing final testing before its official release.

Canary release is a technique to reduce the risk of introducing a new software version in production by first rolling out the change to a small subset of users. After user validation, the application is rolled out to the larger set of users. Citrix ADC-Integrated Canary Deployment Solution stitches together all components of continuous delivery (CD) and makes canary deployment easier for the application developers. This solution uses [Spinnaker](https://www.spinnaker.io/) as the continuous delivery platform and [Kayenta](https://github.com/spinnaker/kayenta) as the Spinnaker plug-in for canary analysis. Kayenta is an open-source canary analysis service that fetches user-configured metrics from their sources, runs statistical tests, and provides an aggregate score for the canary. The score from statistical tests and counters along with the success criteria is used to promote or fail the canary.

Citrix ADC comes with a rich application-centric configuration module and provides complete visibility to application traffic and health of application instances. The capabilities of Citrix ADC to generate accurate performance statistics can be leveraged for Canary analysis to take better decisions about the Canary deployment. In this solution, Citrix ADC is integrated with the Spinnaker platform and acts as a source for providing accurate metrics for analyzing Canary deployment using Kayenta.

 [Citrix ADC Metrics Exporter](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-adc-metrics-exporter) exports the application performance metrics to the open-source monitoring system Prometheus and you can configure Kayenta to fetch the metrics for canary deployment. Traffic distribution to the canary version can be regulated using the Citrix ADC policy infrastructure. If you want to divert a specific kind of traffic from production to baseline and canary, you can use match expressions to redirect traffic to baseline and canary leveraging the rich Citrix ADC policy infrastructure.

For example, you can divert traffic from production to canary and baseline using the match expression HTTP.REQ.URL.CONTAINS("citrix india"). The traffic which matches the expression is diverted to canary and baseline and the remaining traffic goes to production.

The components which are part of the Citrix-Integrated Canary Deployment Solution and their functionalities are explained as follows:

-  [GitHub](https://github.com/): GitHub offers all the distributed version control and source code management functionalities provided by Git and has extra features.
GitHub has many utilities available for integrating with other tools that form part of your CI/CD pipeline like Docker Hub and Spinnaker.

-  [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/): Docker Hub is a cloud-based repository service provided by Docker for sharing and finding Docker images. You can integrate GitHub with Docker Hub to automatically build images from the source code in GitHub and push the built image to Docker Hub.

-  [Spinnaker](https://www.spinnaker.io/): Spinnaker is an open source, multi-cloud continuous delivery platform for releasing software changes with high velocity and reliance. You can use Spinnakerâ€™s application deployment features to construct and manage continuous delivery workflows. The key deployment management construct in Spinnaker is known as a pipeline. Pipelines in Spinnaker consist of a sequence of actions, known as stages. Spinnaker provides various stages for deploying an application, running a script, performing canary analysis, removing the deployment, and so on. You can integrate Spinnaker with many third-party tools to support many extra functionalities.

-  [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/): Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. Prometheus is a monitoring system which can maintain a huge amount of data in a time series database. Citrix ADC Metrics exposes the performance metrics to Spinnaker through Prometheus.

-  [Jenkins](https://jenkins.io/): Jenkins is an open source automation server which helps to automate all sorts of tasks related to building, testing, and delivering or deploying software. Jenkins also supports running custom scripts as part of your deployment cycle.

-  [Citrix ingress controller](https://developer-docs.citrix.com/projects/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/en/latest/): Citrix provides an Ingress Controller for Citrix ADC MPX (hardware), Citrix ADC VPX (virtualized), and Citrix ADC CPX (containerized) for bare metal and cloud deployments. The Citrix ingress controller is built around Kubernetes Ingress and automatically configures one or more Citrix ADCs based on the Ingress resource configuration.

## Software Requirements

Following Citrix software versions are required for Citrix-Integrated Canary Deployment Solution:

-  Citrix ingress controller build/version: `quay.io/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller:canary-b1`.
-  Citrix ADC CPX version: `quay.io/citrix/citrix-k8s-cpx-ingress:13.0-36.2701` and later.
-  Citrix ADC Metrics Exporter version: `quay.io/citrix/netscaler-metrics-exporter:canary-exporter-b1`.

## Workflow of a Spinnaker pipeline for Citrix ADC-Integrated Canary Deployment Solution

The following diagram explains the workflow of a Spinnaker pipeline for Citrix ADC-Integrated Canary Deployment Solution.

![Spinnaker_pipeline](../media/spinnaker_pipeline.png)

The following steps explain the workflow specified in the diagram.

1.  Developers maintain the source code in GitHub, make changes whenever required, and commit the changes to GitHub.
1.  A webhook is configured in GitHub to listen for the source code changes. Whenever the source code is checked in to GitHub, the webhook is triggered and informs Docker Hub to build the image with the new source code. Once the docker image is created, a separate webhook configured in Docker Hub triggers a Spinnaker pipeline.
1.  Once the Spinnaker pipeline is triggered, canary and baseline versions of the image are deployed.
1.  Once the canary and baseline versions are deployed, some percentage of traffic from production is diverted to canary and baseline versions. Citrix ADC collects the performance statistics and exports the statistics to Prometheus with the help of Citrix ADC Metrics Exporter. Prometheus feeds these statistics to Kayenta for canary analysis.
1.	Kayenta performs a canary analysis based on the performance statistics and generates a score. Based on the score, the canary deployment is termed as success or failure and the image is rolled out or rolled back.

The following diagram explains the workflow of a Spinnaker pipeline for Citrix ADC-Integrated Canary Deployment Solution.

## Limitations

The following limitations exist for Citrix ADC-Integrated Canary Deployment Solution:

-  For an existing application which shares Ingress with other applications and requires deploying a canary, either ensure all the applications follow the same deployment strategy or change the Ingress for the application that requires canary deployment.

-  For canary deployment, [smart annotations](https://developer-docs.citrix.com/projects/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/en/latest/configure/annotations/#smart-annotations) are not taken into account from production to canary and baseline versions. Canary and baseline deployment versions do not inherit the properties of the production version.

-  The following Citrix [annotations](https://developer-docs.citrix.com/projects/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/en/latest/configure/annotations/) are not supported:
      -  `insecure-termination`

      -  `path-match-method`

-  For the `secure-service-type` annotation: Only SSL is supported.  
-  For the `insecure-service-type` annotation: Only HTTP is supported.
-  After the creation of a CRD class, there should be a delay of 10 seconds before creating the CRD object for the class.

             config: |
              deploymentConfigurations:	
               notifications:
                slack:
                 enabled: true
                  botName: <BotName>
                  token: <token>
    1.  Once all the required components are integrated, deploy Spinnaker by performing the following step.
   
            kubectl apply -f quick-install.yaml


    1.  Verify the progress of the deployment using the following command. Once the deployment is complete, this command outputs all the pods as Ready x/x. 

            watch kubectl -n spinnaker get pods

1.  Once you deploy Spinnaker, you can test the deployment using the following steps:

    1.  Enable Spinnaker access by forwarding a local port to the deck component of Spinnaker using the following command:
   
            DECK_POD=$(kubectl -n spinnaker get pods -l \
            cluster=spin-deck,app=spin \
            -o=jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}')
            kubectl -n spinnaker port-forward $DECK_POD 8080:9000 >/dev/null &

    1.  To access Spinnaker, in the Cloud Shell, click the **Web Preview icon** and select **Preview on port 8080**.

        !!! note "Note"  
            You can access Spinnaker securely or via HTTP. To expose Spinnaker seurely, use the [spin-ingress-ssl.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/spin-ingress-ssl.yaml) file to deploy the Ingress.
            Once the Spinnaker application is publicly exposed, you can use the domain assigned for Spinnaker or IP address of the Ingress to access it.

### Create a Spinnaker pipeline and configure automated canary deployment

Once you deploy Spinnaker, create a Spinnaker pipeline for an application and configure the automated canary deployment.

1. Create an [application in Spinnaker](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/applications/create/).
2. Create a [Spinnaker pipeline](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/pipeline/managing-pipelines/#create-a-pipeline). You can edit the pipeline as a JSON file using the sample file provided in [Sample JSON files](#A-sample-JSON-file-for-Spinnaker-pipeline-configuration).
3. Create an automated canary configuration in Spinnaker for [automated canary analysis](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/canary/). You can use the configuration provided in the JSON file as a sample for automated canary configuration [Sample JSON files](#A-sample-JSON-file-for-automated-canary-configuration).




### Deploy a sample application for canary

This example shows how to run the canary deployment of a sample application using Citrix ADC-Integrated Canary Deployment solution. In this example, Citrix ADC CPX, MPX, or VPX is deployed as an Ingress device for a GKE cluster. Citrix ADC generates the performance metrics required for canary analysis.

**Prerequisites**

You must complete the following step before deploying the sample application.

- Install Spinnaker and the required plug-ins in Google cloud platform using [Deploy Spinnaker in Google Cloud Platform](#Deploy-Spinnaker-in-Google-Cloud-Platform).

#### Deploy the sample application

Perform the following steps to deploy a sample application as a canary release.

1. Create the necessary RBAC rules for Citrix ADC by deploying the [rbac.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/rbac.yaml) file.
   
        kubectl apply -f rbac.yaml 

1. You can either deploy the Citrix ingress controller as a sidecar with Citrix ADC CPX or as a standalone pod which controls Citrix ADC VPX or MPX.

    Use the [cpx-with-cic-sidecar.yml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/cpx-with-cic-sidecar.yml) file to deploy the Citrix ingress controller as a sidecar with Citrix ADC CPX. It also deploys Citrix ADC Metrics Exporter on the same pod.
    
        kubectl apply -f cpx-with-cic-sidecar.yml 
    
    
     To deploy the Citrix ingress controller as a stand-alone pod for Citrix ADC VPX or MPX use the [cic-vpx.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/cic-vpx.yaml) file. In this deployment, you should use the [exporter.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/exporter.yaml) file to deploy Citrix ADC Metrics Exporter.


        kubectl apply -f cic-vpx.yaml
        kubectl apply -f exporter.yaml

    !!! note "Note"
        Depending on how you are deploying the Citrix ingress controller, you need to edit the YAML file for Citrix ingress controller deployment and modify values for the environmental variables as provided in [deploying Citrix ingress controller](https://developer-docs.citrix.com/projects/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/en/latest/deploy/deploy-cic-yaml/#deploy-citrix-ingress-controller-as-a-pod).

1.  Deploy the Ingress for securely exposing Spinnaker using the [spin-ingress-ssl.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/spin-ingress-ssl.yaml) file.


        kubectl apply -f spin-ingress-ssl.yaml 

    !!! note "Note"
        For more information on creating a TLS certificate for Ingress, see [TLS certificates in Citrix Ingress Controller](https://developer-docs.citrix.com/projects/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/en/latest/certificate-management/tls-certificate-handling/).

1. Once Spinnaker is exposed using Citrix ADC, access Spinnaker and perform the steps in [Create a Spinnaker pipeline and configure automated canary deployment](#Create-a-Spinnaker-pipeline-and-configure-automated-canary-deployment) if the steps are not already done. 
 
1. Deploy the production version of the application using the [production.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/production.yaml) file.
   
        kubectl apply -f production.yaml 

1. Create the Ingress resource rule to expose traffic from outside the cluster to services inside the cluster using the [ingress.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/ingress.yaml) file.
   
        kubectl apply -f ingress.yaml 

1.  Create a Kubernetes service for the application that needs canary deployment using the [service.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/service.yaml) file.

        kubectl apply -f service.yaml

1.  Deploy the canary CRD that defines the canary configuration using the [canary-crd-class.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/canary-crd-class.yaml) file.

        kubectl apply -f canary-crd-class.yaml


    !!! note "Note"
        Once you create the CRD, wait for 10 seconds before you apply the CRD object.

9. Create a CRD object [canary-crd-object.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/canary-crd-object.yaml) based on the canary CRD for customizing the canary configuration.

        kubectl apply -f canary-crd-object.yaml

    The following table explains fields in the canary CRD object.

  
      | Field               | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

      | deployment          | Specifies the deployment strategy as Kayenta.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
      | percentage          | Specifies the percentage of traffic to be diverted from production to baseline and canary.                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
      | newImageTag (optional)        | Specifies the label(key, value pair) to be searched in deployment for checking if it is a canary deployment.

1.  Deploy canary and baseline versions of the application.

    !!! note "Note"
        If you are fully automating the canary deployment, deploy canary and baseline versions using the [Deploy (Manifest) stage](https://www.spinnaker.io/guides/user/kubernetes-v2/deploy-manifest/) in Spinnaker pipeline and there is no need to perform this step.

    For manually deploying canary and baseline versions, use [canary.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/canary/manifest/canary.yaml) and [baseline.yaml](../../canary/manifest/baseline.yaml) files.

        kubectl apply -f canary.yaml
        kubectl apply -f baseline.yaml

## Troubleshooting

For troubleshooting the deployment, perform the following steps.

1.  Check the pod logs for the respective components like Spinnaker, Prometheus, Kayenta, Citrix ADC CPX, Citrix ADC Metrics Exporter, Citrix ingress controller and so on.
1.  Check the pod logs of the Citrix ingress controller for any configuration-related errors while configuring the Citrix proxy.
1.  Search for the ``exception/Exception`` keyword in the Citrix ingress controller pod logs to narrow down the issues.
1.  Check for the logs preceding the search. Check for the configuration that failed and caused the issue.
1.  Check for the reason of failures during configuration.
1.  If the failure happened because of incorrect configuration, correct the configuration.
