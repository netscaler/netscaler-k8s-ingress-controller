# Deploy HTTPS web application on Kubernetes with Citrix Ingress Controller and Hashicorp Vault using cert-manager

This topic provides a sample workflow that uses HashiCorp Vault as self-signed CA to automate TLS certificate provisioning, revocation, and renewal for ingress resources deployed with Citrix ingress controller using cert-manager.

Specifically, the workflow uses the Vault PKI Secrets Engine to create a CA. This tutorial assumes that you have a Vault server installed and reachable from the Kubernetes cluster. The PKI secrets engine of Vault is suitable for internal applications and for external facing applications that require public trust, you can refer [automating TLS certificates using letsencrypt CA](./acme.md)

The workflow uses a Vault secret engine and authentication methods, refer the following Vault documentation for full list of features:

-  [Vault Secrets Engines](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/index.html)

-  [Vault Authentication Methods](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/index.html)

This topic provides you information on how to deploy an HTTPS web application on a Kubernetes cluster, using:

-  Citrix ingress controller (CIC)
-  JetStack's [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager) to provision TLS certificates from [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)
-  [Hashicorp Vault](https://www.vaultproject.io/)

## Prerequisites

Ensure that you have:

-  The Vault server is installed, unsealed and is reachable from Kubernetes cluster.

-  Enabled RBAC on your Kubernetes cluster.

-  Deployed Citrix ADC MPX, VPX or CPX in Tier 1 or Tier 2 deployment model.

    In the Tier 1 deployment model, Citrix ADC MPX or VPX is used as an Application Delivery Controller (ADC) and Citrix Ingress Controller (CIC) running in Kubernetes cluster configures the virtual services for the services running on Kubernetes cluster. Citrix ADC runs the virtual service on the publicly routable IP address and offloads SSL for client traffic with the help of Let's Encrypt generated certificate.
  
    Similarly in the Tier 2 deployment model, a TCP service is configured on the Citrix ADC (VPX/MPX) running outside the Kubernetes cluster to forward the traffic to Citrix ADC CPX instances running in the Kubernetes cluster. Citrix ADC CPX ends the SSL session and load-balances the traffic to actual service pods.

-  Deployed Citrix ingress controller. Click [here](../deployment-topologies.md) for various deployment scenarios.

-  Administrator permissions for all the deployment steps. If you encounter failures due to permissions, make sure you have administrator permission.

## Deploy cert-manager using the manifest file

Perform the following steps to deploy cert-manager using the supplied YAML manifest file.
To keep things simple, skip cert-manager's Helm installation, and instead use the supplied YAML manifests.

1.  Download the latest source of cert-manager from  `github.com/jetstack/cert-manager` repository using the following command.

        wget https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager/archive/v0.6.2.tar.gz
        tar -zxvf v0.6.2.tar.gz

1.  Deploy the cert-manager using the following command.

        kubectl apply -f deploy/manifests/cert-manager.yaml

    You can also install the cert-manager with Helm, for more information see [cert-manager documentation](https://github.com/helm/charts/tree/master/stable/cert-manager)

1.  Verify that the cert-manager is up and running using the following command.

        % kubectl -n cert-manager get all

## Deploy a sample web application

Perform the following steps to deploy a sample web application.

!!! note "Note"
    [Kuard](https://github.com/kubernetes-up-and-running/kuard), a kubernetes demo application is used for reference in this topic.

1.  Create a deployment YAML file (`kuard-deployment.yaml`) for Kuard with the following configuration.

        apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: kuard
        spec:
          replicas: 1
          template:
            metadata:
              labels:
                app: kuard
            spec:
              containers:
              - image: gcr.io/kuar-demo/kuard-amd64:1
                imagePullPolicy: Always
                name: kuard
                ports:
                - containerPort: 8080

1.  Deploy Kuard deployment file (`kuard-deployment.yaml`) to your cluster, using the following commands.

        % kubectl create -f kuard-deployment.yaml
        deployment.extensions/kuard created
        % kubectl get pod -l app=kuard
        NAME                     READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
        kuard-6fc4d89bfb-djljt   1/1     Running   0          24s

1.  Create a service for the deployment. Create a file called `service.yaml` with the following configuration.

        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Service
        metadata:
          name: kuard
        spec:
          ports:
          - port: 80
            targetPort: 8080
            protocol: TCP
          selector:
            app: kuard

1.  Deploy and verify the service using the following command.

        % kubectl create -f service.yaml
        service/kuard created
        % kubectl get svc kuard
        NAME    TYPE        CLUSTER-IP      EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)   AGE
        kuard   ClusterIP   10.103.49.171   <none>        80/TCP    13s

1.  Expose this service to outside world by creating an Ingress that is deployed on Citrix ADC CPX or VPX as Content switching virtual server.

    !!! note "Note"
        Ensure that you change `kubernetes.io/ingress.class` to your ingress class on which CIC is started.

        apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
        kind: Ingress
        metadata:
          name: kuard
          annotations:
            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "citrix"
        spec:
          rules:
          - host: kuard.example.com
            http:
              paths:
              - backend:
                  serviceName: kuard
                  servicePort: 80
  
    !!! info "Important"
        Change the value of `spec.rules.host` to the domain that you control. Ensure that a DNS entry exists to route the traffic to Citrix ADC CPX or VPX.

1.  Deploy the Ingress using the following command.

        % kubectl apply -f ingress.yml
        ingress.extensions/kuard created
        root@ubuntu-vivek-225:~/cert-manager# kubectl get ingress

## Configure Hashicorp Vault as Certificate Authority

Set up an intermediate CA certificate signing request using Hashicorp Vault. This Vault endpoint is used by cert-manager to sign the certificate for the ingress resources.

### Prerequisites

Ensure that you have installed the `jq` utility.

### Create a root CA

For the sample workflow you can generate your own Root Certificate Authority within the Vault. In a production environment, you should use an external Root CA to sign the intermediate CA that Vault uses to generate certificates. If you have a root CA generated elsewhere, skip this step. 

!!! note "Note"
    `PKI_ROOT` is a path where you mount the root CA, typically it is 'pki'. ${DOMAIN} in this procedure is `example.com`

```
% vault secrets enable -path="${PKI_ROOT}" pki

# Set the max TTL for the root CA to 10 years
% vault secrets tune -max-lease-ttl=87600h "${PKI_ROOT}"

% vault write -format=json "${PKI_ROOT}"/root/generate/internal \
 common_name="${DOMAIN} CA root" ttl=87600h | tee \
>(jq -r .data.certificate > ca.pem) \
>(jq -r .data.issuing_ca > issuing_ca.pem) \
>(jq -r .data.private_key > ca-key.pem)

#Configure the CA and CRL URLs:

% vault write "${PKI_ROOT}"/config/urls \
       issuing_certificates="${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/${PKI_ROOT}/ca" \
       crl_distribution_points="${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/${PKI_ROOT}/crl"
```

### Generate an intermediate CA

After creating the root CA, perform the following steps to create an intermediate CSR using the root CA.

1.  Enable pki from a different path `PKI_INT` from root CA, typically `pki\_int`. Use the following command:

        % vault secrets enable -path=${PKI_INT} pki
        Set the max TTL to 3 year

        % vault secrets tune -max-lease-ttl=26280h ${PKI_INT}

2.  Generate CSR for `${DOMAIN}` that needs to be signed by the root CA, the key is stored internally to vault. Use the following command:

        % vault write -format=json "${PKI_INT}"/intermediate/generate/internal \
        common_name="${DOMAIN} CA intermediate" ttl=43800h | tee \
        >(jq -r .data.csr > pki_int.csr) \
        >(jq -r .data.private_key > pki_int.pem)

3.  Generate and sign the `${DOMAIN}` certificate as an intermediate CA using root CA, store it as `intermediate.cert.pem`. Use the following command:

        % vault write -format=json "${PKI_ROOT}"/root/sign-intermediate csr=@pki_int.csr \
                format=pem_bundle \
                | jq -r '.data.certificate' > intermediate.cert.pem

    If you are using an external root CA, skip the above step and sign the CSR manually using root CA.

4.  Once the CSR is signed and the root CA returns a certificate, it needs to added back into the Vault using the following command:

        % vault write "${PKI_INT}"/intermediate/set-signed certificate=@intermediate.cert.pem

5.  Set the CA and CRL location using the following command.

        vault write "${PKI_INT}"/config/urls issuing_certificates="${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/${PKI_INT}/ca" crl_distribution_points="${VAULT_ADDR}/v1/${PKI_INT}/crl"

An intermediate CA is setup and can be used to sign certificates for ingress resources.

### Configure a role

A role is a logical name which maps to policies, administrator can control the certificate generation through the roles.

Create a role for the intermediate CA that provides a set of policies for issuing or signing the certificates using this CA.

There are many configurations that can be configured when creating roles, for more information see, [Vault role documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/api/secret/pki/index.html#create-update-role).

For the workflow, create a role "***kube-ingress***" that allows you to sign certificates of `${DOMAIN}` and its subdomains with a TTL of 90 days.

    # with a Max TTL of 90 days
    vault write ${PKI_INT}/roles/kube-ingress \
              allowed_domains=${DOMAIN} \
              allow_subdomains=true \
              max_ttl="2160h"

## Create Approle based authentication

After configuring an intermediate CA to sign the certificates, you need to provide an authentication mechanism for cert-manager to use the vault for signing the certificates. Cert-manager supports Approle authentication method which provides a way for the applications to access the Vault defined roles.

An "***AppRole***" represents a set of Vault policies and login constraints that must be met to receive a token with those policies. For detailed understanding of this authentication method, see [Approle documentation](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/approle.html).

### Create an Approle

Create an approle named "***Kube-role***". The secret id for cert-manager should not be expired to use this Approle for authentication, hence do not set a TTL, or set it to 0.

    % vault auth enable approle of token ttl 5 minutes

    % vault write auth/approle/role/kube-role \
        token_ttl=5m \
        token_max_ttl=10m

### Associate a policy with the Approle

Perform the following steps to associate a policy with an Approle.

1.  Create a file `pki_int.hcl` with the following configuration to allow the signing endpoints of the intermediate CA.

        path "${PKI_INT}/sign/*" {
              capabilities = ["create","update"]
            }

2.  Add the file to a new policy called `kube_allow_sign` using the following command.

        vault policy write kube-allow-sign pki_int.hcl

3.  Update this policy to the approle using the following command.

        vault write auth/approle/role/kube-role policies=kube-allow-sign

The `kube-role` approle allows you to sign the CSR with intermediate CA.

### Generate the Role id and Secret id

Role id and Secret id is used by cert-manager to authenticate with Vault.

Generate role id and Secret id and encode the `secret_id` with Base64. Perform the following:

    % vault read auth/approle/role/kube-role/role-id
    role_id     db02de05-fa39-4855-059b-67221c5c2f63

    % vault write -f auth/approle/role/kube-role/secret-id
    secret_id               6a174c20-f6de-a53c-74d2-6018fcceff64
    secret_id_accessor      c454f7e5-996e-7230-6074-6ef26b7bcf86

    # encode secret_id with base64
    % echo 6a174c20-f6de-a53c-74d2-6018fcceff64 | Base64
    NmExNzRjMjAtZjZkZS1hNTNjLTc0ZDItNjAxOGZjY2VmZjY0Cg==

## Configure issuing certificates in Kubernetes

After you have configured the Vault as intermediate CA, and the Approle authentication method for cert-manager to access the Vault. You need to configure the certificate for the ingress.

### Create a secret with Approle secret-id

Perform the following to create a secret with Approle secret id.

1.  Create a secret file called `secretid.yaml` with following configuration.

        apiVersion: v1
        kind: Secret
        type: Opaque
        metadata:
          name: cert-manager-vault-approle
          namespace: cert-manager
        data:
          secretId: "NmExNzRjMjAtZjZkZS1hNTNjLTc0ZDItNjAxOGZjY2VmZjY0Cg=="

    !!! note "Note"
        `data.secretId` is the base64 encoded Secret Id generated in [Generate the Role id and Secret id](#generate-the-role-id-and-secret-id). If you're using an Issuer resource in the next step, Secret must be in same namespace as the `Issuer`. For `ClusterIssuer`, secret must be in `cert-manager` namespace.

2.  Deploy the secret file (`secretid.yaml`) using the following command.

        % kubectl create -f secretid.yaml

### Deploy the Vault cluster issuer

Certmanager supports two different CRDs for configuration, an `Issuer`, which is scoped to a single namespace, and a `ClusterIssuer`, which is cluster-wide. For the workflow, you need to use `ClusterIssuer`.

Perform the following steps to deploy the Vault cluster issuer.

1.  Create a file called `issuer-vault.yaml` with the following configuration.

        apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kind: ClusterIssuer
        metadata:
          name: vault-issuer
        spec:
          vault:
            path: ${PKI_INT}/sign/kube-ingress
            server: https://vault_ip
            caBundle: <base64 encoded caBundle PEM file>
            auth:
              appRole:
                path: approle
                roleId: "db02de05-fa39-4855-059b-67221c5c2f63"
                secretRef:
                  name: cert-manager-vault-approle
                  key: secretId

    Replace `PKI_INT` with appropriate path of the intermediate CA. `SecretRef` is the kubernetes secret name created in the previous step. Replace `roleId` with the `role_id` retrieved from Vault.
    An optional base64 encoded caBundle in PEM format can be provided to validate the TLS connection to the Vault Server. When caBundle is set it replaces the CA bundle inside the container running the cert-manager. This parameter has no effect if the connection used is in plain HTTP.

2.  Deploy the file (`issuer-vault.yaml`) using the following command.

        % kubectl create -f issuer-vault.yaml

3.  Using the following command verify if the Vault cluster issuer is successfully authenticated with the Vault.

        % kubectl describe clusterIssuer vault-issuer  | tail -n 7
          Conditions:
            Last Transition Time:  2019-02-26T06:18:40Z
            Message:               Vault verified
            Reason:                VaultVerified
            Status:                True
            Type:                  Ready
        Events:                    <none>

### Create a "certificate" CRD object for the certificate

Once the issuer is successfully registered , you need to get the certificate for the ingress domain `kuard.example.com`.

You need to create a "certificate" resource with the commonName and dnsNames. For more information, see [cert-manager documentation](https://cert-manager.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/certificates.html). You can specify multiple dnsNames which will be used for SAN field in the certificate.

To create a "certificate" CRD object for the certificate, perform the following:

1.  Create a file called `certificate.yaml` with the following configuration.

        apiVersion: certmanager.k8s.io/v1alpha1
        kind: Certificate
        metadata:
          name: kuard-example-tls
          namespace: default
        spec:
          secretName: kuard-example-tls
          issuerRef:
            kind: ClusterIssuer
            name: vault-issuer
          commonName: kuard.example.com
          duration: 720h
          #Renew before 7 days of expiry
          renewBefore: 168h
          commonName: kuard.example.com
          dnsNames:
          - www.kuard.example.com

    The certificate will have CN=`kuard.example.com` and SAN=`Kuard.example.com,www.kuard.example.com`.
    `spec.secretName` is the name of the secret where the certificate is stored after the certificate is issued successfully.

2.  Deploy the file (`certificate.yaml`) on the Kubernetes cluster using the following command.

        kubectl create -f certificate.yaml
        certificate.certmanager.k8s.io/kuard-example-tls created

### Verify if the certificate is issued

You can watch the progress of the certificate as it is issued using the following command:

    % kubectl describe certificates kuard-example-tls  | grep -A5 Events

!!! info "Important"
    You may encounter some errors due to Vault policies. If you encounter any such errors, return to vault and fix it.

After successful signing, a `kubernetes.io/tls` secret is created with the `secretName` specified in the `Certificate` resource.

    % kubectl get secret kuard-example-tls
    NAME                TYPE                DATA   AGE
    kuard-exmaple-tls   kubernetes.io/tls   3      4m20s

## Modify the ingress to use the generated secret

Perform the following steps to modify the ingress to use the generated secret.

1.  Edit the original ingress and add a `spec.tls` section specifying the secret `kuard-example-tls` as follows.

        apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
        kind: Ingress
        metadata:
          name: kuard
          annotations:
            kubernetes.io/ingress.class: "citrix"
        spec:
          tls:
          - hosts:
            - kuard.example.com
            secretName: kuard-example-tls
          rules:
          - host: kuard.example.com
            http:
              paths:
              - backend:
                  serviceName: kuard
                  servicePort: 80

1.  Deploy the ingress using the following command.

        % kubectl apply -f ingress.yml
        ingress.extensions/kuard created

        % kubectl get ingress kuard
        NAME    HOSTS               ADDRESS   PORTS     AGE
        kuard   kuard.example.com             80, 443   12s

1.  Log on to CPX and verify if the Certificate is bound to the SSL virtual server.

        kubectl exec -it cpx-ingress-668bf6695f-4fwh8 bash
        cli_script.sh 'shsslvs'

The HTTPS webserver is UP with the vault signed certificate. Cert-manager automatically renews the certificate as specified in the 'RenewBefore" parameter in the Certificate, before expiry of the certificate.

!!! note "Note"
    The vault signing of the certificate fails if the expiry of a certificate is beyond the expiry of the root CA or intermediate CA. You should ensure that the CA certificates are renewed in advance before the expiry.
