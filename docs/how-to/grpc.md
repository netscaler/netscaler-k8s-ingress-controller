# Enable gRPC support using the Citrix ingress controller

gRPC is a high performance, open-source universal RPC framework created by Google. In gRPC, a client application can directly call methods on a server application from a different server in the same way you call local methods.
You can easily create distributed applications and services using GRPC.

For more information, see [Enabling GRPC support](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/how-to/grpc.html).
