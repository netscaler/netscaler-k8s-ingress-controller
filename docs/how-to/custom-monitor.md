# Creating monitors for applications

The topic covers how to create monitors for applications which would help to load balance applications better.

Citrix ADC supports two types of monitors.

-  Built-in monitors
-  Custom monitors

A smart annotation on Citrix ingress controller can be used for creating various types of monitors for your applications. You can choose between creating a monitor based on a built-in monitor, or creating a custom monitor that uses a script that you write to monitor the service. Once you have chosen or created a monitor, you can use the smart annotation to manage your application monitor lifecycle.
