Ensure that the Kubernetes master is running at `https://kubernetes_master_address:6443` and also the Kubernetes API server pod is up and running. |
| Incorrect service port specified in the YAML file| |Provide the correct port details in the ingress YAML file and reapply to solve the issue. |
|Load balancing virtual server and service group are created but they are down| |Check for the service name and port used in the YAML file. For Citrix ADC VPX, ensure that `--feature-node-watch` is set to `true`, when bringing up the Citrix ingress controller.|
|CS virtual server is not getting created for Citrix ADC VPX.| |Use the annotation, `ingress.citrix.com/frontend-ip`, in the ingress YAML file for Citrix ADC VPX.|

The`- --feature-node-watch` argument needs to be removed from the Citrix ingress controller YAML file. Static routes do not work when Citrix ADC VPX and Kubernetes cluster are in different network.You need to use Citrix node controller to create tunnels between Citrix ADC VPX and cluster nodes.|
|CRD status not updated|**ERROR - [crdinfrautils.py:update_crd_status:42] (MainThread) Exception during CRD status update for negrwaddmuloccmod: 403 Client Error: Forbidden for url: https://10.96.0.1:443/apis/citrix.com/v1/namespaces/default/rewritepolicies/negrwaddmuloccmod/status**| Verify that permission to push CRD status is provided in the RBAC.

Fix the expression and reapply the CRD. |
| Application of a CRD failed. The Citrix ingress controller converts a CRD in to a set of configurations to configure Citrix ADC to the desired state with respect to the specified CRD.

The same log will appear in Citrix ADC as well. Check the Citrix ADC `ns.log` and search for the error string using the `grep` command to figure out the Citrix ADC command which failed during the application of CRD. Try to delete the CRD and add it again. If you see the issue again, report it on the cloud native slack channel.|


## Troubleshooting - Prometheus and Grafana Integration

|**Problem**|**Description**|**Workaround**|
|------|-----|-----|
|Grafana dashboard has no plots|If the graphs on the Grafana dashboards do not have any values plotted, then Grafana is unable to obtain statistics from its datasource.| Check if the Prometheus datasource is saved and working properly. On saving the datasource after providing the Name and IP, a "Data source is working" message appears in green indicating the datasource is reachable and detected. <br>If the dashboard is created using `sample_grafana_dashboard.json`, ensure that the name given to the Prometheus datasource begins with the word "prometheus" in lowercase. <br>Check the Targets page of Prometheus to see if the required target exporter is in `DOWN` state.|
| DOWN: Context deadline exceeded| If the message appears against any of the exporter targets of Prometheus, then Prometheus is either unable to connect to the exporter or unable to fetch all the metrics within the given `scrape_timeout`.|If you are using Prometheus Operator, `scrape_timeout` is adjusted automatically and the error means that the exporter itself is not reachable. <br>If a standalone Prometheus container or pod is used, try increasing the `scrape_interval` and `scrape_timeout` values in the `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.cfg` file to increase the time interval for collecting the metrics.|
