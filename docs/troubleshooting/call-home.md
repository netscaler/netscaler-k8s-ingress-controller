# Call Home enablement for the Netscaler ingress controller in Netscaler

Sometimes, Citrix needs to collect information about the performance of a product to diagnose issues and resolve them. The Call Home feature is designed to gather customer information and upload it to a Citrix server. The Call Home feature can now collect information of the NetScaler configurations orchestrated by NetScaler Ingress Controller.
When the latest version of the Netscaler ingress controller is deployed, a string map is configured on the Netscaler with the Netscaler ingress controller specific information.
