# Call Home enablement for the Netscaler ingress controller in Netscaler

Sometimes, Citrix needs to collect information about the performance of a product to diagnose issues and resolve them. The Call Home feature is designed to gather customer information and upload it to a Citrix server. Now, the Call Home feature available on Netscaler is enabled for the Netscaler ingress controller.
The Call Home feature is enabled by default and requires no specific configuration by users. When the latest version of the Netscaler ingress controller is deployed, a string map is configured on the Netscaler with the Netscaler ingress controller specific information.
