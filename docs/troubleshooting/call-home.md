# Call Home enablement for the Citrix ingress controller in Citrix ADC

Sometimes, Citrix needs to collect information about the performance of a product to diagnose issues and resolve them. The Call Home feature is designed to gather customer information and upload it to a Citrix server. Now, the Call Home feature available on Citrix ADC is enabled for the Citrix ingress controller.
The Call Home feature is enabled by default and requires no specific configuration by users. When the latest version of the Citrix ingress controller is deployed, a string map is configured on the Citrix ADC with the Citrix ingress controller specific information.
