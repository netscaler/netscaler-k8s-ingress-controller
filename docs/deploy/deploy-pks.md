# Deploy the Citrix ingress controller on a PKS managed Kubernetes cluster

[Pivotal Container Service (PKS)](https://pivotal.io/platform/pivotal-container-service) enables operators to provision, operate, and manage enterprise-grade Kubernetes clusters using BOSH and Pivotal Ops Manager.

The [Citrix ingress controller](/docs/index.md) is built around the Kubernetes [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/) and it can automatically configure one or more Citrix ADCs based on the Ingress resource configuration. You can deploy the Citrix ingress controller in a PKS managed Kubernetes cluster to extend the advanced load balancing and traffic management capabilities of Citrix ADC to your cluster.
