# ConfigMap support for the Citrix ingress controller

The ConfigMap API resource holds key-value pairs of configuration data that can be consumed in pods or to store configuration data for system components such as controllers.

ConfigMaps allow you to separate your configurations from your pods and make your workloads portable. Using ConfigMaps, you can easily change and manage your workload configurations and reduce the need to hardcode configuration data to pod specifications.

The Citrix ingress controller supports configuration command line arguments, and environment variables mentioned in [deploying the Citrix ingress controller](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/deployment/baremetal/README.md). But, you cannot update these configurations at runtime without rebooting the Citrix ingress controller pod. With ConfigMap support, you can update the configuration automatically while keeping the Citrix ingress controller pod running. You do not need to restart the pod after the update.

## Supported environment variables in the Citrix ingress controller

The values for the following environment variables in the Citrix ingress controller can be specified in a ConfigMap.

- LOGLEVEL: Specifies the log levels to control the logs generated by Citrix ingress controller (debug, info, critical, and so on). The default value is `debug`.
- NS_HTTP2_SERVER_SIDE: Enables HTTP2 for Citrix ADC service group configurations with possible values as ON or OFF.
- NS_PROTOCOL: Specifies the protocol to establish the ADC session(HTTP/HTTPS). The default value is `http`.
- NS_PORT: Specifies the port to establish a session. The default value is `80`.

**Note:**
This is an initial version of the ConfigMap support and currently supports only a few parameters. Earlier, these parameters were configurable through environment variables except the `NS_HTTP2_SERVER_SIDE` parameter.

## Configuring ConfigMap support for the Citrix ingress controller

This example shows how to create a ConfigMap and apply the ConfigMap to the Citrix ingress controller. It also shows how to reapply the ConfigMap after you make changes. You can also optionally delete the changes.

Perform the following to configure ConfigMap support for the Citrix ingress controller.

1. Create a YAML file `cic-configmap.yaml` with the required key-value pairs in the ConfigMap.

        apiVersion: v1
        kind: ConfigMap
          metadata:
            name: cic-configmap
            labels:
              app: citrix-ingress-controller
            data:
              LOGLEVEL: 'info'
              NS_PROTOCOL: 'http'
              NS_PORT:'80'
              NS_HTTP2_SERVER_SIDE:'ON'

2. Deploy the `cic-configmap.yaml` using the following command.

        kubectl create -f cic-configmap.yaml

3. Edit the `cic.yaml` file for deploying the Citrix ingress controller as a stand-alone pod and specify the following:

        Args:
            - --configmap
                default/cic-configmap
  
    **Note:** It is mandatory to specify the namespace. If the namespace is not specified, ConfigMap is not considered.
    
    Following is a sample YAML file for deploying the Citrix ingress controller with the ConfigMap configuration. For the complete YAML file, see [citrix-k8s-ingress-controller.yaml](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/deployment/baremetal/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller.yaml).
  

        apiVersion: apps/v1
        kind: Deployment
        metadata:
          name: cic-k8s-ingress-controller
        spec:
          selector:
            matchLabels:
              app: cic-k8s-ingress-controller
            replicas: 1
            template:
              metadata:
                name: cic-k8s-ingress-controller
                labels:
                  app: cic-k8s-ingress-controller
               annotations:
               spec: 
                serviceAccountName: cic-k8s-role
                containers:
                - name: cic-k8s-ingress-controller
                  image: "quay.io/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller:1.7.6"
                  env:
                  # Set NetScaler NSIP/SNIP, SNIP in case of HA (mgmt has to be enabled) 
                  - name: "NS_IP"
                    value: "x.x.x.x"
                  - name: "EULA"
                    value: "yes"
                  args:
                    - --ingress-classes
                      citrix
                    - --feature-node-watch
                      false
                    - --configmap
                      default/cic-configmap
                  imagePullPolicy: Always

4. Deploy the Citrix ingress controller as a stand-alone pod by applying the YAML.

        kubectl apply -f cic.yaml

5. If you want to change the value of an environment variable, edit the values in the ConfigMap. In this example, the value of NS_HTTP2_SERVER_SIDE is changed to 'OFF'.

        apiVersion: v1
        kind: ConfigMap
          metadata:
            name: cic-configmap
            labels:
              app: citrix-ingress-controller
            data:
              LOGLEVEL: 'info'
              NS_PROTOCOL: 'http'
              NS_PORT:'80'
              NS_HTTP2_SERVER_SIDE:'OFF'

6. Reapply the ConfigMap using the following command.

        kubectl apply -f cic-configmap.yaml

7. (Optional) If you need to delete the ConfigMap, use the following command.

        kubectl delete -f cic-configmap.yaml

    When you delete the ConfigMap, environment variable configuration falls back as per the following order of precedence:
    ConfigMap configuration > environment variable configuration > default

(Optional) In case, you want to define all keys in a ConfigMap as environment variables in the Citrix ingress controller, use the following in the Citrix ingress controller deployment YAML file.

        envFrom:
                - configMapRef: 
                  name: cic-configmap
