# Deploy the Citrix ingress controller as an OpenShift router plug-in

In an OpenShift cluster, external clients need a way to access the services provided by pods. OpenShift provides two resources for communicating with services running in the cluster: [routes](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/networking/routes.html) and [Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

In an OpenShift cluster, a route exposes a service on a given domain name or associates a domain name with a service. OpenShift routers route external requests to services inside the OpenShift cluster according to the rules specified in routes. When you use the OpenShift router, you must also configure the external DNS to make sure that the traffic is landing on the router.

The Citrix ingress controller can be deployed as a router plug-in in the OpenShift cluster to integrate with Citrix ADCs deployed in your environment. The Citrix ingress controller enables you to use the advanced load balancing and traffic management capabilities of Citrix ADC with your OpenShift cluster.

OpenShift routes can be secured or unsecured. Secured routes specify the TLS termination of the route.

The Citrix ingress controller supports the following OpenShift routes:

-  **Unsecured Routes**: For Unsecured routes, HTTP traffic is not encrypted.

-  **Edge Termination**: For edge termination, TLS is terminated at the router. Traffic from the router to the endpoints over the internal network is not encrypted.

-  **Passthrough Termination**: With passthrough termination, the router is not involved in TLS offloading and encrypted traffic is sent straight to the destination.

-  **Re-encryption Termination**: In re-encryption termination, the router terminates the TLS connection but then establishes another TLS connection to the endpoint.

For detailed information on routes, see the [OpenShift documentation](https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/networking/routes.html#secured-routes).

You can either deploy a Citrix ADC MPX or VPX appliance outside the OpenShift cluster or deploy Citrix ADC CPXs as pods inside the cluster. The Citrix ingress controller integrates Citrix ADCs with the OpenShift cluster and automatically configures Citrix ADCs based on rules specified in routes.

Based on how you want to use Citrix ADC, there are two ways to deploy the Citrix Ingress Controller as a router plug-in in the OpenShift cluster:

-  As a [sidecar](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/pods/pod-overview/) container alongside Citrix ADC CPX in the same pod: In this mode, the Citrix ingress controller configures the Citrix ADC CPX.
  
-  As a standalone pod in the OpenShift cluster: In this mode, you can control the Citrix ADC MPX or VPX appliance deployed outside the cluster.

For information on deploying the Citrix ingress controller to control the OpenShift ingress, see the [Citrix ingress controller for Kubernetes](../index.md).

You can use Citrix ADC for load balancing Openshift control plane (master nodes). Citrix provides a solution to automate the configuration of Citrix ADC using Terraform instead of manually configuring the Citrix ADC.

## Supported Citrix components on OpenShift

| Citrix components | Versions |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| Citrix ingress controller | Latest (1.4.0) |
| Citrix ADC VPX | 12.1 50.x and later |
| Citrix ADC CPX | 13.0â€“36.28 |

**Note:** [CRDs](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/tree/master/crd) provided for the Citrix ingress controller is not supported for OpenShift routes. You can use OpenShift ingress to use CRDs.

## Deploy Citrix ADC CPX as a router within the OpenShift cluster

In this deployment, you can use the Citrix ADC CPX instance for load balancing the North-South traffic to microservices in your OpenShift cluster. The Citrix ingress controller is deployed as a sidecar alongside the Citrix ADC CPX container in the same pod using the [cpx_cic_side_car.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/cpx_cic_side_car.yaml) file.

**Before you begin**

  When you deploy Citrix ADC CPX as a router, port conflicts can arise with the default router in OpenShift. You should remove the default router in OpenShift before deploying Citrix ADC CPX as a router. To remove the default router in OpenShift, perform the following steps:

1.  Back up the default router configuration using the following command.

        oc get -o yaml dc/router clusterrolebinding/router-router-role serviceaccount/router > default-router-backup.yaml

2.  Delete the default router using the following command.

        oc delete -f default-router-backup.yaml

Perform the following steps to deploy Citrix ADC CPX as a router with the Citrix ingress controller as a sidecar.

1.  Download the [cpx_cic_side_car.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/cpx_cic_side_car.yaml) file using the following command:

        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/cpx_cic_side_car.yaml

1.  Add the service account to privileged security context constraints (SCC) of OpenShift.

        oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:default:citrix

1.  Deploy the Citrix ingress controller using the following command:

        oc create -f cpx_cic_side_car.yaml

1.  Verify if the Citrix ingress controller is deployed successfully using the following command:

        oc get pods --all-namespaces

## Deploy Citrix ADC MPX/VPX as a router outside the OpenShift cluster

In this deployment, the Citrix ingress controller which runs as a stand-alone pod allows you to control the Citrix ADC MPX, or VPX appliance from the OpenShift cluster.
You can use the [cic.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/cic.yaml) file for this deployment.

**Note:** The Citrix ADC MPX or VPX can be deployed in *[standalone](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/12-1/getting-started-with-citrix-adc.html)*, *[high-availability](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/12-1/getting-started-with-citrix-adc/configure-ha-first-time.html)*, or *[clustered](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/12-1/clustering.html)* modes.

### Prerequisites

-  Determine the IP address needed by the Citrix ingress controller to communicate with the Citrix ADC appliance. The IP address might be any one of the following depending on the type of Citrix ADC deployment:
    -  NSIP (for standalone appliances): The management IP address of a standalone Citrix ADC appliance. For more information, see [IP Addressing in Citrix ADC](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/12-1/networking/ip-addressing.html).
    -  SNIP (for appliances in High Availability mode):  The subnet IP address. For more information, see [IP Addressing in Citrix ADC](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/12-1/networking/ip-addressing.html).
    -  CLIP (for appliances in clustered mode): The cluster management IP (CLIP) address for a clustered Citrix ADC deployment. For more information, see [IP addressing for a cluster](https://docs.citrix.com/en-us/citrix-adc/12-1/clustering/cluster-overview/ip-addressing.html).
-  The user name and password of the Citrix ADC VPX or MPX appliance used as the Ingress device. If you are not using the default credentials, the Citrix ADC appliance must have a system user account with certain privileges so that the Citrix ingress controller can configure the Citrix ADC MPX, or VPX appliance. To create a system user account on Citrix ADC, see [Create a system user account for the Citrix ingress controller in Citrix ADC](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/docs/deploy/deploy-cic-yaml.md#create-system-user-account-for-citrix-ingress-controller-in-citrix-adc).

    After creating a system user for Citrix ADC, you can create an OpenShift secret using the following command:

        oc create secret generic nslogin --from-literal=username='cic' --from-literal=password='mypassword'

## Deploy the Citrix ingress controller as a pod in an OpenShift cluster

Perform the following steps to deploy the Citrix ingress controller as a pod:

1.  Download the [cic.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/cic.yaml) file using the following command:

        wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/cic.yaml

1.  Edit the [cic.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/cic.yaml) file and enter the values for the following environmental variables:

    | Environment Variable | Mandatory or Optional | Description |
    | ---------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------- |
    | NS_IP | Mandatory | The IP address of the Citrix ADC appliance. For more details, see [Prerequisites](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/tree/master/deployment/openshift#prerequisites). |
    | NS_USER and NS_PASSWORD | Mandatory | The user name and password of the Citrix ADC VPX or MPX appliance used as the Ingress device. For more details, see [Prerequisites](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/tree/master/deployment/openshift#prerequisites). |
    | EULA | Mandatory | The End User License Agreement. Specify the value as `Yes`.|
    | NS_VIP | Optional | Citrix ingress controller uses the IP address provided in this environment variable to configure a virtual IP address to the Citrix ADC that receives Ingress traffic. **Note:**  The [frontend-ip](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/blob/master/docs/configure/annotations.md) value takes precedence over NS_VIP. |

1.  Add the service account to privileged security context constraints (SCC) of OpenShift.

        oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:default:citrix

1.  Save the edited ``cic.yaml`` file and deploy it using the following command:

         oc create -f cic.yaml

1.  Verify if the Citrix ingress controller is deployed successfully using the following command:

        oc create get pods --all-namespaces

## Example: Deploy the Citrix ingress controller as a router plug-in in an OpenShift cluster

In this example, the Citrix ingress controller is deployed as a router plug-in in the OpenShift cluster to load balance an application.

1.  Deploy a sample application ([apache.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/apache.yaml)) in your OpenShift cluster and expose it as a service in your cluster using the following command.

        oc create -f https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/apache.yaml

    **Note:**
        When you deploy a normal Apache pod in OpenShift, it may fail as Apache pod always runs as a root pod. OpenShift has strict security checks which block running a pod as root or binding to port 80. As a workaround, you can add the default service account of the pod to the privileged security context of OpenShift by using the following commands:

            oc adm policy add-scc-to-user privileged system:serviceaccount:default:default
            oc adm policy add-scc-to-group anyuid system:authenticated

2.  Deploy the Citrix ingress controller for Citrix ADC VPX as a stand-alone pod in the OpenShift cluster using the steps in [Deploy the Citrix ingress controller as a pod](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/tree/master/deployment/openshift#deploy-the-citrix-ingress-controller-as-a-pod-in-an-openshift-cluster).

        oc create -f cic.yaml

    **Note:**
        To deploy the Citrix ingress controller with Citrix ADC CPX in the OpenShift cluster, perform the steps in [Deploy the Citrix ingress controller as a sidecar with Citrix ADC CPX](https://github.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/tree/master/deployment/openshift#deploy-citrix-adc-cpx-as-a-router-within-the-openshift-cluster).

3.  Create an OpenShift route for exposing the application.

    -  For creating an unsecured OpenShift route ([unsecured-route.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/unsecured-route.yaml)), use the following command:

            oc create -f unsecured-route.yaml

    -  For creating a secured OpenShift route with edge termination ([secured-edge-route.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/secured-edge-route.yaml)), use the following command.

            oc create -f secured-route-edge.yaml

    -  For creating a secured OpenShift route with passthrough termination ([secured-passthrough-route.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/secured-passthrough-route.yaml)), use the following command.

            oc create -f secured-passthrough-route.yaml

    -  For creating a secured OpenShift route with re-encryption termination ([secured-reencrypt-route.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/citrix/citrix-k8s-ingress-controller/master/deployment/openshift/manifest/secured-reencrypt-route.yaml)), use the following command.

            oc create -f secured-reencrypt-route.yaml

    **Note:**
        For a secured OpenShift route with passthrough termination, you must include the default certificate.

4.  Access the application using the following command.

      ```
      curl http://<VIP of Citrix ADC VPX>/ -H 'Host: < host-name-as-per-the-host-configuration-in-route >'
      ```
