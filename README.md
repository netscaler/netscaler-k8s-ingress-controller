# **What is an Ingress Controller?**

Configuring a  ADC is harder in kubernetes environment where microservices will be scaling up and down.
The Ingress resource simplifies the configuration, and an Ingress controller is meant to handle it.
An Ingress Controller is a daemon, deployed as a Kubernetes Pod, that watches the apiserver for ingresses  updates and configures the Ingress ADC accordingly.
