# Contributing to the Citrix ingress controller

 We are glad to know that you want to contribute to this project! This document helps to answer common questions you may have during your first contribution.

## Submitting issues

 Not every contribution comes in the form of code. Submitting, confirming, and triaging issues is an important task for any project. This project uses GitHub to track all project issues. You can use Issues to submit feature requests.

 We ask you not to submit security concerns through GitHub. For details on submitting potential security issues, see [reporting security issues to Citrix](https://support.citrix.com/article/CTX081743).

## Code contributions

 At this point, we are not accepting code contributions from outside Citrix for this project. You can raise an issue if you want to see a feature.
